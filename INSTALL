                                  you have Red Hat Linux or Solaris).

  BSD::Resource    optional       If you want resource limits to avoid certain
				  types of denial of service (DoS) attack.

  Digest::MD5      optional       If you want the SITE CHECKSUM command

  File::Sync       optional	  Needed for SITE SYNC command.

  Getopt::Long     required       This is usually supplied as part of the
                                  basic Perl package.

  IO               required       This is also normally included in the
                                  basic Perl package, but make sure you
                                  have a pretty recent version.

                                  test suite. Make sure you have at least

				  some important bug fixes.
