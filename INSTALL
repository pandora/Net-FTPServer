Installing Net::FTPServer
-------------------------

Prerequisites:

  Authen::PAM      optional       If you want to do PAM authentication (eg.
                                  you have Red Hat Linux or Solaris).

  BSD::Resource    optional       If you want resource limits to avoid certain
				  types of denial of service (DoS) attack.

  Digest::MD5      optional       If you want the SITE CHECKSUM command
                                  to work correctly.

  Getopt::Long     required       This is usually supplied as part of the
                                  basic Perl package.

  IO               required       This is also normally included in the
                                  basic Perl package, but make sure you
                                  have a pretty recent version.

  IO-stringy       required       You will need this in order to run the
                                  test suite. Make sure you have at least
				  version 1.220 from CPAN.

To compile:

  perl Makefile.PL
  make
  make test

To install (usually as root):

  make install

The documentation should be automatically installed. Do:

Information on how to start and stop the FTP server is
contained in the manual page.
