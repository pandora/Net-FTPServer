Installing Net::FTPServer
-------------------------

Prerequisites:

  Authen::PAM      optional       If you want to do PAM authentication (eg.
                                  you have Red Hat Linux or Solaris).
  BSD::Resource    required
  Digest::MD5      optional       If you want the SITE CHECKSUM command
                                  to work correctly.
  Getopt::Long     required       This is usually supplied as part of the
                                  basic Perl package.

I have tested this on perl 5.00503 & Red Hat Linux 6.0 only.

To compile:

  perl Makefile.PL
  make
  make test

To install (usually as root):

  make install

The documentation should be automatically installed. Do:

  man Net::FTPServer

or if you don't have a working man pages system, do:

  pod2man lib/Net/FTPServer.pm | nroff -man | more

Information on how to start and stop the FTP server is
contained in the manual page.
