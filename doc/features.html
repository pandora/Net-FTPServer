    <h1>Bibliotech Net::FTPServer Features</h1>

    <a name="security"><h2>Security</h2>

    <p>
      Net::FTPServer is written in Perl. Perl is
      inherently more robust than the C language
      which is commonly used to write FTP servers.
      Perl is not open to the usual stack smashing
      exploits, unlike C. In addition, everything
      sent by the client process is marked as tainted
      and cannot be passed to shell programs without
      special attention and treatment.
    </p>

    <p>
      The server doesn't launch external programs
      to produce directory listings and so on.
    </p>

    <p>
      For additional security, it is easy to
      configure the server to run
      as a special user and/or to run inside
      a chrooted environment.
    </p>

    <p>
      The code is <i>not</i> derived from wu-ftpd
      and so does not inherit the security problems
      found in other wu-ftpd derived servers.
    </p>

    <a name="extensible"><h3>Extensible</h3>

    <p>
      Net::FTPServer can be extended in two major
      ways: by adding <i>personalities</i> and
      by customizing the <i>virtual filesystem</i>.
    </p>

    <p>
      By adding personalities you can change the
      way that the server works in deep ways:
      for example, changing the authentication
      mechanism, making the server anonymous-only
      or disabling and enabling commands.
    </p>

    <p>
      By adding a new virtual filesystem layer
      you can make the FTP server serve files
      from a database, for example.
    </p>

    <a name="configurable"><h3>Configurable</h3>

    <p>
      Net::FTPServer is highly configurable, either
      from the configuration file, or by writing
      extensions in Perl.
    </p>

    <p>
      For example, you can limit every type of
      server operation using simple snippets of
      Perl inserted into the configuration file.
      Or you can make deep configuration changes
      by deriving a class from <tt>Net::FTPServer</tt>
      and adding your own code directly.
