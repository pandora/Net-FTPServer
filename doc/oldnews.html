		<p>
		  <a href="files/Net-FTPServer-1.0.4.tar.gz">Version 1.0.4</a>
		  released. A small patch from Rob Brown which
		  avoids the server leaving zombie processes
		  lying around in some situations.
		</p>

		<p><b>Fri Mar  2 11:04:17 GMT 2001</b></p>

		<p>
		  <a href="files/Net-FTPServer-1.0.3.tar.gz">Version 1.0.3</a>
		  released. This version contains patches to make the
		  full server work correctly on OpenBSD. (Thanks
		  to Azazel).
		</p>

		<p><b>Wed Feb 28 16:40:11 GMT 2001</b></p>

		<p>
		  <a href="files/Net-FTPServer-1.0.2.tar.gz">Version 1.0.2</a>
		  released. This contains some necessary bugfixes over
		  the 1.0.0 and 1.0.1 releases.
		  <a href="http://www.annexia.org/cgi-bin/autopatch.pl?dir=ftp">Patch
		    to this version</a> if you
		  had problems with those releases. (Thanks to Rob
		  Brown for these fixes).
		</p>

		<p><b>Tue Feb 27 10:43:44 GMT 2001</b></p>

		<p>
		  <a href="files/Net-FTPServer-1.0.1.tar.gz">Version 1.0.1</a>
		  released. I've done next to nothing for this release,
		  but Rob Brown has been at it again, producing a
		  beautiful series of bug fixes and enhancements.
		  In no particular order:
		  Avoid hard coded "." and ".." entries in directories.
		  Logging is taint-clean in Perl 5.005. Don't log
		  out-of-band data into client log.
		  Added ident (RFC 1413) logging for increased security.
		  Added "time zone" configuration file option so
		  that dates and times can appear in zones other
		  than GMT.
		  Allow parent daemon to be restarted
		  cleanly even if there are child daemons still
		  left over from the previous process.
		  Sending SIGHUP causes the parent process to cleanly
		  restart, reload configuration files and reopen
		  client logging file (this even works if the
		  daemon has bound to a low-numbered port and dropped
		  priviledges).
		</p>

		  <b><a href="files/Net-FTPServer-1.0.0.tar.gz">Version
		      1.0.0</a> released!</b> Go and read our
		  <a href="press1.0.txt">press release</a>.
		</p>

		<p>
		  Fixed for this release by Rich: <tt>STOU</tt>
		  now works. Listing
		  files by wildcard now works in the "in memory"
		  personality. Added
		  <tt>STOR</tt>/<tt>STOU</tt>/<tt>APPE</tt> tests. Added
		  <tt>LIST</tt>/<tt>NLST</tt> tests. Added
		  <tt>SITE IDLE</tt> test. Added <tt>SITE
		  VERSION</tt> test. Added <tt>REST</tt> test.
		  Added <tt>RNFR/RNTO</tt>
		  test. Added <tt>ABOR</tt> test. Added "no authentication
		  commands" configuration option.
		</p>

		<p>
		  Fixed for this release by Rob Brown: "Client logging"
		  feature. Distinguish between sending TERM to the
		  daemonized process and to the child processes.
		  Implement <tt>ABOR</tt>-ted transfers using SIGURG.
		  Added <tt>post_bind_hook</tt>.
		  DoS attack avoided by reseting
		  the alarm after read and before write. Abort if
		  configuration file is missing. Added
		  <tt>transfer_hook</tt>.
		</p>

		<p><b>Sun Feb 18 23:37:14 GMT 2001</b></p>

		<p>
		  <a href="files/Net-FTPServer-0.9.9.tar.gz">Version 0.9.9</a>
		  released. This fixes a nasty bug with uploading
		  ASCII files. Also added:
		  A fairly complete test suite [Rich].
		  A cute "in memory" personality [Rich]. Catch errors on
		  ASCII STOR (upload) and report to the client [Rob Brown].
		  Eliminate the idle transfer DoS bug [Rob Brown].
		  Never reset the ALRM catcher to inifinity (alarm 0)
		  [Rob Brown].
		  Pull all clients that are idle even mid-transfer
		  [Rob Brown].
		  Avoid timing out clients that are actively transfering
		  [Rob Brown]. Missing files added to the MANIFEST [Rich].
		</p>

		<p>
		  <a href="files/Net-FTPServer-0.9.8.tar.gz">Version 0.9.8</a>
		  released. In no particular order:
		  Port numbers opened by the FTP server in passive mode
		  can be configured in ranges from the configuration file
		  (this should improve things if you run a firewall in
		  front of your server).
		  Removed extra spaces in "Entering Passive Mode" string.
		  Code tidying.
		  Add "print" method to IO::Blob - you can now upload
		  ASCII files to the database.
		  In STOR, error messages actually reflect error
		  conditions.
		  Fixed calls to syswrite().
		  Incomplete three-way TCP handshake no longer crashes
		  the server.
		  Add -P option on the command line to supply name of
		  pidfile.
		  Delete pidfile when main process dies.
		  (Thanks to Rob Brown at about-inc.com for the bulk
		  of these fixes).

		<p>
		  <a href="files/Net-FTPServer-0.9.6.tar.gz">Version 0.9.6</a>
		  released. Fixed a bug with LISTing files in
		  subdirectories (thanks to all @about-inc.com).
		</p>

		<p><b>Fri Dec 22 13:04:42 GMT 2000</b></p>

		<p>
		  <a href="files/Net-FTPServer-0.9.5.tar.gz">Version 0.9.5</a>
		  released. I fixed a raft of portability problems
		  on Solaris 2.7. However, there remains a problem
		  that the Perl version I have on Solaris doesn't
		  call <code>initgroups(3)</code> correctly when
		  the process GID is changed, and
		  hence doesn't drop privileges properly. This is
		  beyond my experience to fix -- seemingly requiring
		  deep changes to Perl itself? It also works OK on
		  Linux and *BSD, and that's all that really concerns
		  me anyway.
		</p>

		<p><b>Sat Dec  9 17:56:34 GMT 2000</b></p>

		<p>
		  I presented a short speech about Net::FTPServer
		  to the Greater London Linux User Group. You
		  can read it
		  <a href="speech/title.html">here</a>.

		<p><b>Fri Dec  8 23:50:14 GMT 2000</b></p>

		<p>
		  <a href="files/Net-FTPServer-0.9.4.tar.gz">Version 0.9.4</a>
		  released. Fixed a few problems with older versions
		  of PostgreSQL (versions &lt;= 6.3).
		</p>

		<p><b>Sat Nov 25 13:39:52 GMT 2000</b></p>

		<p>
		  <a href="files/Net-FTPServer-0.9.3.tar.gz">Version 0.9.3</a>
		  released. Fixed compatibility problems with ncftp
		  versions 2.4.3 and 3.0.2. Mostly fixed MLST/MLSD
		  commands. Added --help option. Fixed -V option.
		</p>

		<p><b>Fri Nov  3 18:14:05 GMT 2000</b></p>

		<p>
		  <a href="files/Net-FTPServer-0.9.2.tar.gz">Version 0.9.2</a>
		  released. Bug fixes and clean ups.
		</p>

		<p><b>Fri Nov  3 13:38:14 GMT 2000</b></p>

		<p>
		  <a href="files/Net-FTPServer-0.9.1.tar.gz">Version 0.9.1</a>
		  released. Many documentation updates. Added
		  easily customizable SITE commands.
		</p>

		<p><b>Thu Nov  2 18:39:30 GMT 2000</b></p>

		<p>
		  <a href="files/Net-FTPServer-0.9.0.tar.gz">Version 0.9.0</a>
		  released. Added a anonymous read-only FTP
		  personality. With this personality, the
		  FTP server contains <i>no code</i> which could
		  be used to write, create directories, delete
		  files, etc. The FTP server will also only
		  accept anonymous logins, and contains no
		  code for checking <tt>/etc/passwd</tt> or PAM.
		  This is a candidate for a 1.0.0 release.
		  Please download it, play with it, and send
		  me your feedback.

		<p><b>Thu Nov  2 18:09:12 GMT 2000</b></p>

		<p>
		  <a href="files/Net-FTPServer-0.8.4.tar.gz">Version 0.8.4</a>
		  released. Added the missing database schema.
		</p>

		<p><b>Thu Nov  2 18:01:52 GMT 2000</b></p>

		<p>
		  <a href="files/Net-FTPServer-0.8.3.tar.gz">Version 0.8.3</a>
		  released. This version has a fairly complete
		  example database back-end for those that
		  wanted to see that.
		</p>

		<p><b>Thu Nov  2 14:10:21 GMT 2000</b></p>

		<p>
		  <a href="files/Net-FTPServer-0.8.0.tar.gz">Version 0.8.0</a>
		  released. This is a highly experimental release
		  which adds a partially implemented database
		  back-end. This is just for people interested
		  in database back-ends to the FTP server.
		</p>

		<p><b>Wed Oct 25 10:31:45 BST 2000</b></p>

		<p>
		  <a href="files/Net-FTPServer-0.7.2.tar.gz">Version 0.7.2</a>
		  released. This fixes a problem when

		<p><b>Tue Oct 24 17:28:06 BST 2000</b></p>

		<p>
		  <a href="files/Net-FTPServer-0.7.1.tar.gz">Version 0.7.1</a>

		  Several important bug fixes, including an important fix
		  to access control rules (thanks to
		  Matthew Gabeler-Lee for pointing this one out).
		</p>

		<p><b>Wed Sep 27 16:13:27 BST 2000</b></p>

		<p>
		  <a href="files/Net-FTPServer-0.6.1.tar.gz">Version 0.6.1</a>
		  released. This release is highly experimental,
		  but I did all of 5 minutes of testing and
		  <i>it appeared to work for me</i>. Changes:
		  bug fixes and enhancements too numerous
		  to mention. Major change: separated out the file
		  access back-end to improve security (our database
		  version now no longer contains redundant
		  file access code). Included a few more
		  documents.
		</p>

		<p><b>Thu Sep 14 11:04:33 BST 2000</b></p>

		<p>
		  <a href="files/Net-FTPServer-0.5.1.tar.gz">Version 0.5.1</a>
