		<p>
		  <a href="files/Net-FTPServer-0.9.9.tar.gz">Version 0.9.9</a>
		  released. This fixes a nasty bug with uploading
		  ASCII files. Also added:
		  A fairly complete test suite [Rich].
		  A cute "in memory" personality [Rich]. Catch errors on
		  ASCII STOR (upload) and report to the client [Rob Brown].
		  Eliminate the idle transfer DoS bug [Rob Brown].
		  Never reset the ALRM catcher to inifinity (alarm 0)
		  [Rob Brown].
		  Pull all clients that are idle even mid-transfer
		  [Rob Brown].
		  Avoid timing out clients that are actively transfering
		  [Rob Brown]. Missing files added to the MANIFEST [Rich].

		<p>
		  <a href="files/Net-FTPServer-0.9.8.tar.gz">Version 0.9.8</a>
		  released. In no particular order:
		  Port numbers opened by the FTP server in passive mode
		  can be configured in ranges from the configuration file
		  (this should improve things if you run a firewall in
		  front of your server).
		  Removed extra spaces in "Entering Passive Mode" string.
		  Code tidying.
		  Add "print" method to IO::Blob - you can now upload
		  ASCII files to the database.
		  In STOR, error messages actually reflect error
		  conditions.
		  Fixed calls to syswrite().
		  Incomplete three-way TCP handshake no longer crashes
		  the server.
		  Add -P option on the command line to supply name of
		  pidfile.
		  Delete pidfile when main process dies.
		  (Thanks to Rob Brown at about-inc.com for the bulk
		  of these fixes).

		<p>
		  <a href="files/Net-FTPServer-0.9.6.tar.gz">Version 0.9.6</a>
		  released. Fixed a bug with LISTing files in
		  subdirectories (thanks to all @about-inc.com).
		</p>

		<p><b>Fri Dec 22 13:04:42 GMT 2000</b></p>

		<p>
		  <a href="files/Net-FTPServer-0.9.5.tar.gz">Version 0.9.5</a>
		  released. I fixed a raft of portability problems
		  on Solaris 2.7. However, there remains a problem
		  that the Perl version I have on Solaris doesn't
		  call <code>initgroups(3)</code> correctly when
		  the process GID is changed, and
		  hence doesn't drop privileges properly. This is
		  beyond my experience to fix -- seemingly requiring
		  deep changes to Perl itself? It also works OK on
		  Linux and *BSD, and that's all that really concerns
		  me anyway.
		</p>

		<p><b>Sat Dec  9 17:56:34 GMT 2000</b></p>

		<p>
		  I presented a short speech about Net::FTPServer
		  to the Greater London Linux User Group. You
		  can read it
		  <a href="speech/title.html">here</a>.
		</p>

		<p><b>Fri Dec  8 23:50:14 GMT 2000</b></p>

		<p>
		  <a href="files/Net-FTPServer-0.9.4.tar.gz">Version 0.9.4</a>
		  released. Fixed a few problems with older versions
		  of PostgreSQL (versions &lt;= 6.3).
		</p>

		<p><b>Sat Nov 25 13:39:52 GMT 2000</b></p>

		<p>
		  <a href="files/Net-FTPServer-0.9.3.tar.gz">Version 0.9.3</a>
		  released. Fixed compatibility problems with ncftp
		  versions 2.4.3 and 3.0.2. Mostly fixed MLST/MLSD
		  commands. Added --help option. Fixed -V option.
		</p>

		<p><b>Fri Nov  3 18:14:05 GMT 2000</b></p>

		<p>
		  <a href="files/Net-FTPServer-0.9.2.tar.gz">Version 0.9.2</a>
		  released. Bug fixes and clean ups.
		</p>

		<p><b>Fri Nov  3 13:38:14 GMT 2000</b></p>

		<p>
		  <a href="files/Net-FTPServer-0.9.1.tar.gz">Version 0.9.1</a>
		  released. Many documentation updates. Added
		  easily customizable SITE commands.
		</p>

		<p><b>Thu Nov  2 18:39:30 GMT 2000</b></p>

		<p>
		  <a href="files/Net-FTPServer-0.9.0.tar.gz">Version 0.9.0</a>
		  released. Added a anonymous read-only FTP
		  personality. With this personality, the
		  FTP server contains <i>no code</i> which could
		  be used to write, create directories, delete
		  files, etc. The FTP server will also only
		  accept anonymous logins, and contains no
		  code for checking <tt>/etc/passwd</tt> or PAM.
		  This is a candidate for a 1.0.0 release.
		  Please download it, play with it, and send
		  me your feedback.
		</p>

		<p><b>Thu Nov  2 18:09:12 GMT 2000</b></p>

		<p>
		  <a href="files/Net-FTPServer-0.8.4.tar.gz">Version 0.8.4</a>
		  released. Added the missing database schema.
		</p>

		<p><b>Thu Nov  2 18:01:52 GMT 2000</b></p>

		<p>
		  <a href="files/Net-FTPServer-0.8.3.tar.gz">Version 0.8.3</a>
		  released. This version has a fairly complete
		  example database back-end for those that
		  wanted to see that.
		</p>

		<p><b>Thu Nov  2 14:10:21 GMT 2000</b></p>

		<p>
		  <a href="files/Net-FTPServer-0.8.0.tar.gz">Version 0.8.0</a>
		  released. This is a highly experimental release
		  which adds a partially implemented database
		  back-end. This is just for people interested
		  in database back-ends to the FTP server.
		</p>

		<p><b>Wed Oct 25 10:31:45 BST 2000</b></p>

		<p>
		  <a href="files/Net-FTPServer-0.7.2.tar.gz">Version 0.7.2</a>

		<p><b>Tue Oct 24 17:28:06 BST 2000</b></p>

		<p>
		  <a href="files/Net-FTPServer-0.7.1.tar.gz">Version 0.7.1</a>

		  Several important bug fixes, including an important fix

		  Matthew Gabeler-Lee for pointing this one out).
		</p>

		<p><b>Wed Sep 27 16:13:27 BST 2000</b></p>

		<p>
		  <a href="files/Net-FTPServer-0.6.1.tar.gz">Version 0.6.1</a>
		  released. This release is highly experimental,
		  but I did all of 5 minutes of testing and
		  <i>it appeared to work for me</i>. Changes:
		  bug fixes and enhancements too numerous
		  to mention. Major change: separated out the file
		  access back-end to improve security (our database
		  version now no longer contains redundant
		  file access code). Included a few more
		  documents.
		</p>

		<p><b>Thu Sep 14 11:04:33 BST 2000</b></p>

		<p>
		  <a href="files/Net-FTPServer-0.5.1.tar.gz">Version 0.5.1</a>
